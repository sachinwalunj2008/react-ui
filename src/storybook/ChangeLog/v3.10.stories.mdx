### 3.10.3

Added an optional prop to `TextInput` called `maxDecimalPlaces`. This will restrict the number of demical places for a number input.

**06-July-2022**

### 3.10.2

Added a prop to `PrimaryActionButton` for disabling the secondary action button.
Changed the logic so an empty actions array still displays the `MenuButton` version as long as the actions prop exists.
Also added box shadow.

---

### 3.10.1

Added `useIsMounted` hook for general use.
This will provide a uniform way to verify if a component is mounted before updated the component state.

---

**05-July-2022**

### 3.10.0

Created new `PrimaryActionButton` component, meant to replace `BulkActions`.
It can be used as either a `MenuButton` or a `Button` that shows up in the bottom right corner of the screen.
The `MenuButton` version accepts a list of actions that can be individually disabled.
