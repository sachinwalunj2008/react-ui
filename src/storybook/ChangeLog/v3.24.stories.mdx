### 3.24.0

** Breaking Change **

We updated react-router-dom to v6. This comes with breaking changes in regards to programatic
navigation. For example: `useHistory` is no longer a hook. We needed to replace that with
`useNavigate`. However, at the moment all of our apps do not support v6 so we had to extract any
`useHistory` and `useNavigation` logic to be handled by the consuming application. The leftover
`useNavigation` hooks are used in Storybook and work fine.
