### 3.29.5

Allow for graph lines to connect through null data points. The null value will not have
it's own data point on the graph but the graph line will connect existing data points
to make a continuous line graph. The graph line will start with the first valid data point
and will end with the last valid data point. Only the gaps between valid data points will
be connected.

To allow this continuous graph line use the `connectNulls` param. The default value is false.

### 3.29.4

Fixed missing right column border. The border disappeared if the custom columns options
was used with nested rows. Also, the right column border was missing on the nested rows.
This fixes both issues so that the right border will now be displayed on if both Custom
columns and nested rows are used and the right border will be continued in the nested
rows too.

**18-April-2023**

Added the label props back in to the exposed version of `MultipleSelection`. We decided that we do not want to hide the label like we initially thought.

### 3.29.3

`InlineMultiSelect` props updates:

- Added `exposed`, `className`, `style`, and `showGradient` to help with styling of the exposed `MultipleSelection`.

`MultipleSelection` props updates:

- Reorganized props to be more strict for our new "exposed" experience.
- Added `exposed` prop to remove the "popover" experience and show the `MultipleSelction` inline.
- Added the `maxHeight` prop to allow the exposed version of the component to adjust the height. This can be useful in a `SideDrawer`.
