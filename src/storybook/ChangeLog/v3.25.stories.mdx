### 3.25.0

Created the new `InformationPane` component. This component allows the flexibility of using custom children elements (per design requirements). It is recommended to use the components that are available in the `InformationPane.tsx` file for design consistency:

`<InformationPane.ImageAndName />`
`<InformationPane.Section />`
`<InformationPane.CustomSection />`
`<InformationPane.Divider />`
