### 3.30.8

Updated the base Sparkline chart to use similar params as the SparklineWithTooltip component.
The Sparkline chart is a separate component that does not have the tooltip feature. It is
just a display component. Still WIP until tested.

[Sparkline](/story/wip-sparkline--default)

Updated the mobile display for the SparklineWithTooltip component. When this component is
displayed on a mobile device it will open a sideDrawer instead of the popover component. This
will make the display more standard on mobile devices.

### 3.30.4

Add a `SecondaryDisplay` prop which is add a JSX component to the `SparklineWithTooltip` display.
If no SecondaryDisplay prop is provided then the tooltip will display only the initial graph. But
if a SecondaryDisplay prop is provided then the tooltip will display the additional component in
a side container and will dynamically adjust the size of the tooltip to accommodate the new component.
For mobile the graph and the new component will stack vertically.

### 3.30.3

Removed the `callout` prop from `Icon`. In an order to help with accessibility, our standards are to wrap a `Button` around an `Icon` if we need a callout for the `Icon`. This is has been adopted in more recent implementations. We are enforcing this standard with this update.

[Icon](/story/components-icon--icon)

### 3.30.2

Added a third option to the prop `size` for `InfoTooltip`. The new option, `standard`, will be the default `size`. We added this prop to help with our CSS encapsulation task.

### 3.30.1

Added an optional prop called `keyUpCallout` to `SearchBar`. This will allow an action to be taken up pressing "return" or "enter" on the keyboard.

[SearchBar](/story/components-searchbar--key-up)

### 3.30.0

Created the `CustomizeTableColumns` component. This will replace the `CustomDisplay` that the tables are currently using to customize their columns. This component makes use of a `SideDrawer` and the exposed version of `MultipleSelection`. The same `customColumnProps` are being used so no changes are necessary to the current experience.
